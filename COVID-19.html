        <h2>My COVID-19 reading</h2>
        <h4>5/27/2020</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Infection Control</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fitted N-95 respiratory along with other PPEs and negative pressure room for aerosol-generating procedures
                        <p><i>Aerosol-generating procedures in the ICU include: endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, physical proning of the patient, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</i></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Surgical/medical masks along with other PPEs for non-aerosol-generating procedures.</li>
                    <li>Video-guided laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation by experienced provider.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resuscitation in patients with COVID-19 and shock</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>There are very low-quality evidence regarding restricted vs. liberal use of fluid resuscitation. Clinician should constantly assess fluid responsiveness and status of ARDS when administering fluid resuscitation.</li>
                    <li>Norepinephrine should be used as the first-line vasoactive agent. If not available, vasopressin or epinephrine can be used.</li>
                    <li>Vasopressin is the recommended second-line agent.</li>
                    <li>MAP goal for vasoactive agents should be 60-65mmHg.</li>
                    <li>When cardiac dysfunction is present and hypoperfusion not responding to norepinephrine alone, dobutamine is suggested over increasing norepinephrine dose.</li>
                    <li>Corticosteroid for shock is recommended, typical dosing hydrocortisone 200mg qd.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Managing respiratory failure</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supplemental O2 is recommended when SpO2 is below 92%. Goal of SpO2 should be no higher than 96%.</li>
                    <li>HFNC not NIPPV should be attempted if failed conventional nasal oxygen

                    </li>
                    <li>For vented patients with ARDS, low tidal volume ventilation is recommended.

                    </li>

                    <li>Target plateu pressure should be &lt; 30mmH2O. </li>
                    <li>Higher PEEP strategy is recommended.</li>
                    <li>Prone ventilation is recommended in those with moderate to severe ARDS for 12-16 hours</li>
                    <li>As needed intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for moderate to severe ARDS</li>
                    <li> In the event of persistent ventilator dyssynchrony, the need for ongoing deep sedation, prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures, we suggest using a continuous NMBA infusion for up to 48 hours </li>
                    <li>Pulmonary vasodilator may be used as a rescue therapy</li>
                    <li>Inhaled nitric oxide has potential harm and no clear mortality benefit, therefore it is not recommended. It could cause rebound pulmonary vasoconstriction.</li>
                    <li>Traditional recruitment maneuvers can be used for persistent hypoxia.</li>
                    <li>VV-ECMO if nothing works</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>COVID-19 treatment</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cytokine Storm Syndrome: In vented patients, the presence of ARDS could justify systemic corticosteroids use.</li>
                    <li>Empiric antibiotics should be given for patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure</li>
                    <li>Routine use of IVIG is not recommended</li>
                    <li>Routine use of convalescent plasma is not recommended. Efficacy and safety is unclear.</li>
                    <li>Routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended. In a recent trial from China, the drug did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality. The drug has generally good safety profile, but may have interactions with many drugs
                    </li>
                    <li>In ICU patients, there is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation regarding antiviral agents for COVID-19. More evidence is needed for remdisivir, rIFNs, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, and tocilizumab.</li>
                </ol>
